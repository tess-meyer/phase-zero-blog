        <h2>EQ vs IQ</h2>

           <p> A quick google search will surface many different definitions of emotional intelligence. One definition is below:
            
            "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions” Salovey and Mayer 1990
            
            I found that EQ is a combination of a number of skills working together. Most of these are soft skills centered around being mindful of the feelings of yourself and others. </p>
            

            <ul>
                <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
                <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                <li>Relating to others</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>These abilities are distinctly different from those represented by IQ which are</p>
            
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
            <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
            
            <p>Both lists are equally important, however the emotional intelligence list is rarely taught in traditional schooling environments.
            
            Emotional intelligence is much more than it used to because the workplace has changed. Today we work largely in teams, not isolation, for one thing, and companies are realizing that recognizing emotions exist can lead to healthier environments, rather than expecting employees to leave their emotions at the door. This doesn’t mean it’s an emotional free-for-all by any means, but it does mean people are more likely to be aware of their own and others’ emotions and act accordingly. People with higher emotional intelligence are also more adaptable to change- a must in our fast-changing digital age.
