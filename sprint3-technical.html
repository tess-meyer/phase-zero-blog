     <h2>HTML + CSS</h2>
        <p>If you were to build a sentence with programming languages, HTML would be the nouns and CSS would be the adjectives. HTML gives you &ldquo;a cat&rdquo; but HTML+CSS gives you &ldquo;a very fluffy orange cat&rdquo;.</p>
      <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which code is read and executed. This is usually from top to bottom but you can control this using javascript as well.</p>
      <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>A loop in JS is something that keeps repeating until the conditions are met. It&rsquo;s like when you brush your hair. You repeat the motions until all the knots are out and then you stop. You don&rsquo;t just keep brushing indefinitely and the number of brushes can vary depending on how many knots you had in the first place.</p>
      <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>The DOM, or Document Object Model is what we use to interact with web pages. We can use the DOM to add, delete or change content on an html document.</p>
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. It acts as a list of what is inside the variable. You can access the values by referring to an index number. Instead of</p>
        <p>var cat1 = "Breezy";</p>
        <p>var cat2 = "Pickles";</p>
        <p>var cat3 = "Frodo";</p>
        <p>You can now have var cats = ["Breezy", "Pickles", "Frodo"];<br /><br /></p>
        <p>To access data from an array, you can refer to an index number. For example var name = cats[0]; will access breezy because she is the first element and array indexes start with [0] instead of [1]
        </p>
      <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>An object is a container for <strong>named values </strong>called properties or methods. Just like a real object you can give it properties to describe it. For example:<br /><br /></p>
        <p>var cat = {firstName:"Breezy", lastName:"Meow", age:18, eyeColor:"Brown"};</p>
        <p>You can access properties from an object in two different ways. Either with a dot or with square brackets and quotes.
          This is seen as breezy.lastName; or breezy["lastName"];
        </p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>A function is a a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. The code inside the function will execute when something calls the function. This can be a few things like when an event occurs (when a user clicks a button) or when it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.</p>
        <p>Functions are useful because you can outline a set of instructions that you can apply lots of different times, to different things so you don&rsquo;t have to write out the same &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; over and over again.</p>
