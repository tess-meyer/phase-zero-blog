      <h1>My Bootcamp learning plan </h1>

  <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
  <p>My long term goals have stayed pretty true to what they were in my initial learning
     plan for foundations. I really want to use the skills I gain to for good, working
      somewhere that aligns with my values and is environmentally conscious. I&rsquo;m not
       sure yet where this will lead me but i&rsquo;m incredibly excited for the future.</p>
  <p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></p>
  <p>I think my strengths and limitations were pretty accurate. My anxiety about big tasks 
    did hinder me a little bit but my courage and motivation took over and got the job done. 
    I really like the quote &ldquo;Fear is a reaction. Courage is a decision.&rdquo; because
     it puts the solution in your hands and reminds people that while you can&rsquo;t choose 
     what you get worried about you can decide how much you let it affect you.</p>
  <p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></p>
  <p>I think staying on top of the material will be quite tricky for me because there is just 
    SO MUCH of it. Staying focused for such long hours will also be quite hard for me. I really
     rely on sleep to be able to function and really struggle with less than 8-9 hours and 
     i&rsquo;ve never had much success doing any kind of study after 7-8pm. I think exercise 
     will be a big key to success with this so I have more energy and sleep better but I am
      worried about how the long hours will impact me.</p>
  <p><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in 
    yourself while at EDA?</strong></p>
  <p>I would like to become more confident and develop my leadership skills. I have always
     been one of the youngest at my previous jobs and I think it made me feel uncomfortable
      to try and take up a leadership position when I really would have been more than qualified.</p>
  <p>I also need to learn how to receive negative feedback and see it as an opportunity to 
    grow rather than something bad.</p>
  <p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong><br /><br /></p>
  <p>Above all I expect them to be approachable and understanding. As long as I feel like 
    I can ask them for help when I need it, i&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
  <h2><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong></h2>
  <p>I know the workload is going to be very intense at (all?) times and i&rsquo;ll do my
     best to work smart AND hard and be as productive as possible. I plan on using the 
     knowledge of my peers and teachers and the internet to my advantage, and asking for
      help early and often before a problem snowballs into something much bigger.</p>

  <h1> My Foundations Learning Plan </h1>
  <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I want to work somewhere that aligns with my personal values. A sustainable startup, charity or not-for-profit would suit me well. I have been learning a lot recently about how much help our environment really needs and I can’t think of anything else more important than helping that cause.</li> 
      <li>I want to be stable enough to get a dog and ideally take it with me to work as well.</li>
      <li>I want to continue learning every day. I chose Web Development because I know there will be problems to solve every single day and I look forward to the exciting new challenges.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Non-tech skills I would like to develop</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I would like to learn how to act in a professional setting. I have only ever had jobs where management is extremely laid back and relaxed and have never been in anything remotely close to an office job. </li>
        <li>Networking - During my day in the life experience Rohan described tech in NZ as “nepotism on steroids”. I’d like to learn more effective ways to network and make connections.</li>
        <li>Time management - I blame shift work for making me only productive for half a day at a time. I need to bust these habits and this mindset and learn to manage my time more effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <li>Courage</li>
      <li>Curiosity </li>
      <li>Empathy </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Anxiety</li>
      <li>Discipline</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
    I think one of my biggest assets is my courage. It’s an interesting one because
    I am also a very anxious person by nature and tend to worry a lot everything both 
    little and big (one of my limitations) - but because I worry about things no matter
     their size, and that I have to do anyway, it almost offsets the same worry that 
     I feel for big leaps and because I am used to “feeling the fear and doing it anyway”
      I can push past it and take on much larger challenges than what is expected of me. For
      example i’ll be just as nervous about ordering takeaways on the phone as I am about
       making a speech in front of 50 people, or buying a one way ticket to africa by 
      myself... It’s quite a strange way to live but it is working for me so far and has lead
      me to do some incredible things that would only be possible with big leaps. 
      </p>
  <h3>My commitment</h3>
    <p>I am fully committed to EDA and will do everything I can to ensure success both 
      in my own learning and that of my peers. I will tackle my learning week-by-week and one 
      step at a time, always breaking bigger problems down into more manageable ones. I’ll work 
      with my cohort on common problems and work on my communication skills throughout the course. 
    When I get stuck on a coding problem I will first try and fully understand what the problem 
    really is. Then i’ll break it down into smaller parts and google them to see what I can find.
     If google isn’t working i’ll reach out to the slack channels if i’m not on campus or to a
      teacher or other student on campus if i’m there.
    If I come across a non-tech problem (life problem?) I’ll contact Allie or another member 
    of the facilitation team as soon as possible if I think it will affect my learning.
    I expect the facilitation team to be approachable, dependable and understanding. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling</h3>
  <p>I don’t have any block-out times however I am definitely a morning person and am much more productive in the morning than the afternoon. I also have boxing at 6pm on Mondays and Thursdays. These are optional but I do feel like they are hugely beneficial and I always have a much better week when I attend so ideally will leave campus in time to get to those sessions. </p>
