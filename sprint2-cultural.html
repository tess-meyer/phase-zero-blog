<h1> My Draft Learning Plan </h1>
<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to work somewhere that aligns with my personal values. A sustainable startup, charity or not-for-profit would suit me well. I have been learning a lot recently about how much help our environment really needs and I can’t think of anything else more important than helping that cause.</li> 
<li>I want to be stable enough to get a dog and ideally take it with me to work as well.</li>
<li>I want to continue learning every day. I chose Web Development because I know there will be problems to solve every single day and I look forward to the exciting new challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-tech skills I would like to develop</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I would like to learn how to act in a professional setting. I have only ever had jobs where management is extremely laid back and relaxed and have never been in anything remotely close to an office job. </li>
    <li>Networking - During my day in the life experience Rohan described tech in NZ as “nepotism on steroids”. I’d like to learn more effective ways to network and make connections.</li>
    <li>Time management - I blame shift work for making me only productive for half a day at a time. I need to bust these habits and this mindset and learn to manage my time more effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<li>Courage</li>
<li>Curiosity </li>
<li>Empathy </li>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Discipline</li>
</ul>
I think one of my biggest assets is my courage. It’s an interesting one because I am also a very anxious person by nature and tend to worry a lot everything both little and big (one of my limitations) - but because I worry about things no matter their size, and that I have to do anyway, it almost offsets the same worry that I feel for big leaps and because I am used to “feeling the fear and doing it anyway” I can push past it and take on much larger challenges than what is expected of me. For example i’ll be just as nervous about ordering takeaways on the phone as I am about making a speech in front of 50 people, or buying a one way ticket to africa by myself... It’s quite a strange way to live but it is working for me so far and has lead me to do some incredible things that would only be possible with big leaps. 
<h3>My commitment</h3>
<p>I am fully committed to EDA and will do everything I can to ensure success both in my own learning and that of my peers. I will tackle my learning week-by-week and one step at a time, always breaking bigger problems down into more manageable ones. I’ll work with my cohort on common problems and work on my communication skills throughout the course. 
When I get stuck on a coding problem I will first try and fully understand what the problem really is. Then i’ll break it down into smaller parts and google them to see what I can find. If google isn’t working i’ll reach out to the slack channels if i’m not on campus or to a teacher or other student on campus if i’m there.
If I come across a non-tech problem (life problem?) I’ll contact Allie or another member of the facilitation team as soon as possible if I think it will affect my learning.
I expect the facilitation team to be approachable, dependable and understanding. </p>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>I don’t have any block-out times however I am definitely a morning person and am much more productive in the morning than the afternoon. I also have boxing at 6pm on Mondays and Thursdays. These are optional but I do feel like they are hugely beneficial and I always have a much better week when I attend so ideally will leave campus in time to get to those sessions. </p>
