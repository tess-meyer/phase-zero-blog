        <h2>How does neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
         <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit people (and their brains) hugely. When people realise that the brain can actually change itself by forming new connections and pathways they will be more motivated to study harder and try for big goals that they otherwise might not go for. A lot of people think that this is only the case for children, but it is not hardwired beyond change even far into adulthood. It also links in closely with developing a growth mindset or a "not yet mindset.</p>
        <h2>How I will use neuroplasticity for my own benefit</h2>
         <p>I will try and use the principles of neuroplasticity to develop better work habits. If I keep being susceptible to distraction (checking phone, opening facebook, looking at dog instagrams) then that will not change as the pathways in my brain will become stronger and stronger and those things will become even stronger habits. However if I do it less and instead stick to my pomodoro timers, drink more water, and keep my phone off - then the pathways for those things will become stronger and eventually habits that will be stronger than my old ones that lead me off task.</p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
         <p>One way to increase your neuroplasticity is to practice mindfulness. If you are more aware of your surroundings and thoughts and especially aware of what's going in your brain, you will be more likely to make better, more meaningful descisions.</p>
         <p>Another way to increase your neuroplasticity is to find a strong purpose for what you are trying to learn. Science shows that that brain change will be more significant if you're motivated and alert. If you really want to change and are committed to it then this will be much easier than if you didn't feel as strongly about your goal.</p>

        <h2>What is growth mindset?</h2>
         <p>To have a growth mindset is to believe that your talents and abilities can grow and change. This is in contrast to a fixed mindset which is believing that you have set abilities which will not change "I am bad at art so I will never be able to paint" is an example of fixed mindset, whereas someone with a growth mindset would say "If I practice enough I will be able to learn how to paint".</p>
         <p>Growth mindset is relevant because learning to be a programmer is HARD. There have been times during foundations when i've encountered things I just couldn't seem to figure out no matter how hard I tried. But I know that with enough hard work I am capable of learning just about everything so I know it will be okay. Growth mindset is incredibly important because otherwise it would be far too easy to give up.</p>
        <h2>Surprises?</h2>
         <p>I found out about neuroplasticity and growth mindset in the foundations prep phase so this wasn't new content to me but it was a timely reminder of these things after a very tricky sprint last week.</p>
        <h2>How I will integrate growth mindset into your learning journey</h2>
         <p>Going forward I will need to remind myself to keep a growth mindset and the belief that I can do anything I put my (growth) mind to. Deep down I know this is the case but it's very easy to forget when you start drowning in a challenge.</p>

         <p>I like this video because it is short and clear. I have added it to my bookmarks bar as a reminder to watch it when I feel like I can't do anything and get back into the right headspace.</p>
        <h2>Blending with my learning plan and strategies</h2>
         <p>With added understanding of growth mindset and neuroplasticity I will be able to execute my learning plan with fewer roadblocks. If something gets in my way I will have the growth mindset video in my bookmarks to remind me that I can and will get over the problem. Once I watch this enough times, the pathways in my brain will be strong enough that I won't need the video anymore and will automatically be reminded of my growth mindset and will see the challenges I face as an opportunity to learn, grow and develop new systems.</p>
