            <p><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result 
            of the core learning?</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>I learned that sometimes all I need to keep working hard on a problem I want to give
                     up on is to remember &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s right I can do anything&rdquo;</li>
                <li>I learned a lot about my values and what really drives me.</li>
                <li>I learnt how important conscious listening is.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
            <p>I was most surprised by the different levels of engagement everyone had with the 
                content. It was really interesting talking to other Kotare about it and seeing how 
                everyone took the information and used it in different ways.</p>
            <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
            <p>I found the identity and values exploration one of the more challenging aspects. This was 
                mainly because I had never really thought about them a whole lot, and being 20 I still 
                have a lot more to figure out. I knew that family, friends and the environment were the 
                things I cared about the most but I had never gone much deeper than that.</p>
            <p><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on 
                core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></p>
            <p>I think there is such a focus on core learning because learning to code is HARD and we 
                need every tool we can get to get through it and become good developers. It&rsquo;s also 
                challenging some stereotypes that developers can&rsquo;t talk to people, and creating 
                developers that can not only talk to people but also know how to <em>listen</em> and make
                 good team mates.</p>
            <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </strong></p>
            <p>The time spent on core learning really didn&rsquo;t feel like a waste of time. I felt like 
                I gained useful insight every exercise that we did that helped me with my code (and other
                 areas of life). If nothing else, the time spent working on core learning was also a really 
                 nice break from coding and provided some time where there were less blocks and everything flowed 
                 smoothly which was incredibly refreshing and necessary.</p>
