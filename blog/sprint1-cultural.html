Strengths and limitations.


“You’re like the most motivated person i’ve ever met” “just a go getter - just like yes let’s do the thing!! But with everything you do” - my flatmate

I think the my stand-out strengths are my courage and motivation. Motivation however, will only get you so far. By solely using motivation it is hard to get a lot done because unless I care a lot about something it will be really hard to find motivation. This is where discipline come in. 

Discipline is something I am working on but having been out of school for a few years now is probably a weakness/limitation of mine and something that I have to work on. 

Another of my limitations is that I do feel things quite intensely emotionally. While this often allows me to connect with others on a deeper level, I definitely see it as a limitation, and something that can cause problems particularly when under stress, criticism or conflict.

Tough decisions

On a cycle trip recently, my friend and I rode mast a girl sitting on the side of the road outside a local high school and stopped to ask her if she was okay. She ended up being not very okay - we found out that she was an exchange student from korea and didn’t have a way home, know her address, or have any credit on her phone to call her host mother. We also found out her host mother didn’t sound like a very nice person. 

What was the right thing to do here? Do we call the police not knowing the whole story and risk the host mother getting wrongly accused of something and making it worse for the girl at home? Do we leave her because it’s not our place to interfere? Do we contact the school? Do we take her with us to our hotel because we can’t seem to contact her host mother? 

Both knowing how it feels to be alone and on the other side of the world we called the host mother from my phone a few times, leaving messages for her with the location of the girl. She eventually called back, very angry, accusing us of sticking our noses in where we didn’t belong. But we just wanted to do the right thing by the girl while causing the least harm possible so tried to calmly negotiate getting her a lift home. 

The consequences of us stopping for her and calling the mum meant we were verbally attacked and accused but because we cared more about being kind and looking after the exchange student it really didn’t bother us. 


My culture

Initially I was unsure about how to describe my culture. A quick google search on kiwi culture told me 	“The culture of New Zealand is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique environment and geographic isolation of the islands, and the cultural input of the indigenous Māori people and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand.”		I find this to be an accurate description for me as well. Growing up Pakeha in New Zealand was as far as I can tell as it would have been anywhere in the world. I have tried to understand and appreciate all of the different cultures around me however, and they have also become part of who I am. Being in a Kapa Haka group in primary, Poly Club in high school, learning German to an almost fluent level, and Spanish to a much less than fluent one, being bought to tears after talking to a primary school about sustainability when they sung Tutira Mai to thank us, all of these cultures are part of who I am now. At my core, I try to respect both the people and the environment around me and really treat others the way I would like to be treated - just like mum always told me. 

Strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career development

The description below is from my myers-briggs personality test and resonates VERY strongly with me. I couldn’t really have described it any more accurately.

“Can’t I fly helicopters AND be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?” It’s a big world out there – perhaps even a little too big. Campaigners are fascinated by new ideas, both in terms of developments in fields they are already familiar with, and when new subjects come along. The trick for people with the Campaigner personality type is to take advantage of this quality, this wonder with the magnificent breadth and detail in the world, and to use it to propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go. If there’s a challenge Campaigners face when selecting a career, it isn’t that they lack talent or options or drive, it’s that there are so many things out there that are just cool.

Again, I couldn’t have said this better myself. EDA wasn’t my only plan for this year. I was trying to decide between training to become a firefighter, studying environmental science at Victoria, moving to Japan to become a ski instructor or web development. I ended up choosing Dev Academy but the other options may all happen at some point in my future. 


Working with others

An experience where I was trying to work productively with others was my experience as an ESOL teacher in Peru. The kids spoke almost no English and I had even less spanish so communication and trying to get the allotted work done was tough at best. I eventually figured out that just repeating myself was definitely not effective but that trying to talk in the most simple english possible and phrasing things in as many ways as possible was very effective and eventually my message got across. The best thing I did was actually learn more and more Spanish which made things exponentially easier. I think that whether it is a complete different language or not, trying to speak in familiar terms to the people you are trying to communicate with is always useful (eg. trying not to use jargon with non-tech people). 



Ko au te moana, ko te moana ko au 
I am the ocean, the ocean is me.
