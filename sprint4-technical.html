            <h2>Problems!</h2>
            <p>I got 99 problems and coding is almost all of them. This was a really tough sprint for me. The first two kata&rsquo;s tricked me into a false sense of security and from 3 onwards I found them really hard and there was no longer that sense of achievement coming from doing things right because it seemed like everything I tried was wrong (despite doing the research!). When I got really stuck I googled things which worked maybe 20% of the time and when that wouldn&rsquo;t work i&rsquo;d have a break and do something non-coding related then get back to it. I found breaking problems into smaller ones was the best method for me to get all the pieces together, but I still struggled putting all of those pieces together into working code. In any case there is a lot of room for improvement so watch this space!</p>
            <h2>Problem solving techniques:</h2>
            <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
            <p>Pseudocode really helps break down the problem into smaller ones and is something I should have tried harder to do more of.</p>
            <h2>Trying something</h2>
            <p>Almost everything I tried didn&rsquo;t work but I know I will feel more confident trying things as my base knowledge expands over the next 12 weeks.</p>
            <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
            <p>I LOVE this method. Anyone that knows me knows how much I love a good rubber duck. I already had one on my desk at home so this was a great technique for me and I felt very confident using it. Whether it be my rubber ducky, my boyfriend, my houseplants or my flatmates, I was constantly talking about the problems that I was facing during this sprint which really helped me get my head around them.</p>
            <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
            <p>At the start the error messages were as clear as mud to me but I am getting more confident reading them and am finding them easier and easier to decipher.</p>
            <h2>Console.logging</h2>
            <p>I haven&rsquo;t been doing this for long but I have been finding it really helpful to test out functions and to get more information - I found it especially helpful in the where are you challenge&hellip; although I am still yet to have working code for this it gave me useful information about the arrays.</p>
            <h2>Googling</h2>
            <p>Google and I have grown up together. We were actually created only months apart so I actually can&rsquo;t remember a world without it! So of course I find it an incredibly useful resource. I&rsquo;ve been particularly enjoying youtube videos to avoid excessive walls of text as well.</p>
            <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
            <p>I have depended on my cohort a lot this week. Even just keeping each other on track has been really good. I feel confident asking them for help and know that it benefits them as well to explain things another way.</p>
            <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
            <p>This is something I should have been doing earlier. I probably haven&rsquo;t been doing this enough but i&rsquo;m sure I will depend on them more and more as the weeks go on.</p>
            <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
            <p>I haven&rsquo;t been confident enough in my code yet to improve it too much once finished but I do find reflection has helped me pinpoint where I went wrong / got distracted / didn&rsquo;t do enough. I have also started reflecting on each day writing every night about ways I looked after myself and things that I am grateful for and I have found this really rounds the days off nicely and has me sleeping better doing something not coding related right before bed.</p>
